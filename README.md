Enriching stock market data using Open AI API
The Nasdaq-100 is a stock market index made up of 101 equity securities issued by 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It helps investors compare stock prices with previous prices to determine market performance.

In this project you are provided with two CSV files containing Nasdaq-100 stock information:

nasdaq100.csv: contains information about companies in the index such as symbol, name, etc.
nasdaq100_price_change.csv: contains price changes per stock across periods including (but not limited to) one day, five days, one month, six months, one year, etc.
As an AI developer, you will leverage the OpenAI API to classify companies into sectors and produce a summary of sector and company performance for this year.
